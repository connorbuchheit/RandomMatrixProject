# RandomMatrixProject
AM205 final project about random matrices

I am drafting stuff in messingaround.ipynb. 

I think this project needs better direction â€” so far, we have waffled around on what we want to do. Started with eigenvalues and random matrices (e.g. how resolvent changes, where eigenvalues are distributed, etc.), but felt like it were not aligned too closely with the spirit of this class.

We are currently curious about the iterative Ax=b algorithms that were briefly discussed in class (GMRES, Conjugate Gradient (CG), or BiCGSTAB) and factors that impact their convergence, but we are entirely open to a) different ideas, or b) extensions of this idea.
